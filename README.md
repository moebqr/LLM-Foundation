# Foundational Introduction to LLMs - Learning Resource

## ü§î Why I Built This Resource

I often get asked: *‚ÄúHow do I start learning about LLMs?‚Äù* The field can be intimidating, with countless research papers and complex concepts to grasp. I wanted to create a **free, accessible resource** that breaks down the essential knowledge into manageable parts.

That‚Äôs why I built this site‚Äîcurating **12 of the most influential papers on LLMs and Transformers** and pairing each with an **AI-generated podcast** to make learning both engaging and convenient. My goal is to help others get up to speed and stay ahead in the AI landscape by exploring foundational concepts in a more digestible format.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/):

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications
- [React](https://reactjs.org): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com): A collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): A cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with Next.js for deployment


The combination of these technologies allows for a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience while maintaining code quality and developer productivity (got to build the entire site in less than a couple of hours).
